This is the simplest example to replay applications using Feign and SIOX traces.

## An Application: program.c => program

The example program by default writes "abc" to a file (test.tmp), closes 
the file and terminates. Feel free to modify it and experiment.

Build the sample application by invoking make:

   $ make

## Obtaining the trace using SIOX

SIOX and the POSIX instrumentation is expected to be installed on the system.
To trace the application you can use the following command:

    $ trace.sh mytrace

This will create a directory "mytrace" and then trace the example application
"program" using the siox-inst utility. You can inspect the obtained trace by
using the siox-trace-reader command. Make sure to specify the correct
activities.dat file.

	$ cd mytrace
	$ siox-trace-reader --afile activities.dat1234

SIOX will create multiple files including a binary 

## Replaying using Feign

Again we expect that Feign has already been installed. After you have obtained
a application trace with SIOX you can replay it with feign. This requires that
that the Feign plugins for POSIX and SIOX have been build. In particular you
need to load a plugin combination like the following one:

* libfeign_posix-siox-provider.so
* libfeign_posix-precreator.so
* libfeign_posix-replayer.so

The feign-siox-posix.sh shell script serves as example how to load plugins and
can also be used to replay a trace. For example you can try to replay the
demo-trace by invoking the following command:

    $ replay.sh mytrace

Note: You can also replace "mytrace" with "demo-trace" to replay the trace
in the demo-trace directory.

The following demo shows how to use context aware plugins to modify taces.
Make sure you got the "../siox-replay" demo running before trying this one.

The example case, uses previously recorded trace data and injects fadvise

The plugin code can be found and modified in the "feign_posix-fadvise-injection"
directory.

	cd feign_posix-fadvise-injection

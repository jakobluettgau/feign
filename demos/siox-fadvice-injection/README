The following demo shows how to use context aware plugins to modify taces.
Make sure you got the "../siox-replay" demo running before trying this one.

The example case, uses previously recorded trace data and injects fadvise 
readahead hints automatically. 

Unfortunetly the tracefiles are very large, which si why they are not provided
with the repository. You can however easily generate the trace files when you
have SIOX installed. Run make to create the executables and user trace.sh
to create an application trace.

	make
	./trace.sh demo-trace ../fadvise-readAhead.withoutfadvise.stride12288.think100


The optimizer plugin can be found and modified in the "feign_posix-fadvise-injection"
directory. You may use waf to build the modified plugin.

	cd feign_posix-fadvise-injection
	$FEIGN/waf

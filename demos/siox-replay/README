This is the simplest example to replay applications using Feign and SIOX traces.

## The Application: program.c => program

The example program by default writes "abc" to a file (test.tmp), closes 
the file and terminates. Feel free to modify it and experiment.

Build the sample application by invoking make:

   $ make

## Obtaining the trace using SIOX

SIOX and the POSIX instrumentation is expected to be installed on the system.
To trace the application you can use the following command:

    $ siox-inst posix ./program

You can inspect the trace by using the siox-trace-reader command. Make sure to
specify the correct activities.dat file.

   $ siox-trace-reader --afile activities.dat1234

SIOX will create multiple files including a binary 

## Replaying using Feign

Again we expect that Feign has already been installed. After you have obtained
a application trace with SIOX you can replay it with feign. This requires that
that the Feign plugins for POSIX and SIOX have been build. In particular you
need the shared object files:

* libfeign-posix-replayer.so
* libfeign-posix-precreator.so
* libfeign-posix-siox-reader.so

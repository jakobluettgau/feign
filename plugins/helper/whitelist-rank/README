Context aware mutation plugin that inserts fadvise function calls before
a certain pattern.

Requirements:
	You need to have the SIOX-POSIX Plugins generated. Without changes to the
	build scripts these are expected to reside in "../../../plugins/posix".

	The datatypes header file is especially important. Correct the symlink
	if necessary.

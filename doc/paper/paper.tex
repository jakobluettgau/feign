\begin{abstract}
Quickly evaluating application performance across different systems is usually
a very work intensive task that requires in dept knowledge of the original and
the target systems especially when it comes to evaluating parallel software.
\emph{Feign} aims to be a extendible trace replay solution for parallel
application traces that supports arbitrary software and library layers. The
tool abstracts and streamlines the replay process while allowing plugins to
provide, manipulate and interpret the trace data.  Through these plugins it
becomes possible to retract and add optimization or apply other systematic
changes to achieve meaningful replay.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Today most high performance computers are cluster computers \cite{Top500}.
Cluster computers introduce complexity on many levels because of the variety of
different technologies they utilize. This includes not only hardware and
software but also topologies and they are combined. That is because of the
different demands characteristics of scientific applications as described by
the thirteen dwarfs\cite{Asanovic2006}.

Storage and network technologies are common bottlenecks.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

While there is no lack of sequential replayers, there is not many tools available
in the domain of parallel computers. Also the tools that are publicly available
are not modular and hard to extend. But a monolitic solutions is impractical
when it comes to meet the diverse demands of parallel systems.

It is also important to realize that
